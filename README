alpaca: yet another compiler generator, a little more flexible, maybe a little more useful
====================================================

alpaca (pronounced just like the South American cute mammal's name is pronounced in your language)
is a tool for programming language developers. It aims at combining a subset of the
features found at traditional generators, as flex (lex) and bison (yacc) in one single
environment, allowing projetists to quickly create a basic infrastrucuture for language
development and focus on semantics, instead of syntatics.

flex is a general purpose tool create scanners that recognize regular languages; bison is
a general purpose tool to create parsers that recognize context-free languages. alpaca is
a general purpose tool do generate basic infrastrucuture that recognizes a new
(general purpose/domain specific) programming language's syntatic structures, generate and
represents its AST and does other preparations for the next translation steps. Since
it's aimed at language developers, the code generated by alpaca is human-readable and
the tool offers options so it can be fine tuned to fit specific frameworks and patterns.

Be warned: it is early days for the alpaca project.  New contributors
and users are more than welcome, but beware of bugs and instability issues.

Some features:
 - Scanner, parser and AST can be described and seamlessly integrated in one single tool.
 - Intuitive and easy to use description language.
 - Human-readable and mantainable generated code.
 - Support to C, C++, Java and Python and to extensions for new languages.

See INSTALL for install instructions.  It's the usual GNU process!
